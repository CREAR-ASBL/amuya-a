# Amuyña
Application that generates and designs Tables of deduction

## Instructions
You need to compile the program using java v.1.8.0 (I don't know if it would work with previous versions).

There is only one dependency: Gson, which is a library to convert Java Objects into their JSON representation and vice-versa. You need to download that library first and import it. Unfortunatly I only know how to do that with Netbeans:

1. Create a new project.
2. Add the content of the amuyaña /src/ folder to your /src/ project.
3. In the 'Projects' tab, right click in 'libraries' and select 'Add JAR/Folder', then chose 'gson-2.8.0.jar' (if you download that version).
4. Compile and run.
